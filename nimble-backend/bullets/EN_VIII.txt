-2. Separate Recording of Materials: The Packaging Ordinance required the separate recording of materials targeted for diversion from landfills and incineration plants. This was a mandatory prerequisite for diverting the partial flow with subsequent ecologically acceptable disposal outside of landfills and classic waste incineration. The associated costs were imposed on the population via the retail price of the packaged goods.


-Linking the activity to product stewardship was meant to anchor responsibility in a sub-area of economic life.
-This did not result in an increase in costs or stricter requirements for the population.
-Over time, this changed after the danger of the impending disposal emergency had been overcome.
-The original requirement for separate collection was no longer applicable and the trade was not the right contact for producer liability.
-He was not a producer and only had indirect opportunities to influence production.
-The positive effects were correspondingly small.


-Misgivings were reinforced by the development of a superior, partially competing, private-law process
-State's right to regulate economic processes is subject to the principle of least interference
-Separation requirement was removed due to lack of constitutional legitimacy
-1998 amendment to the Packaging Ordinance marked the turning point in time


-Amendment of the Closed Substance Cycle Waste Management Act in 2015 made separation of recyclable waste a legal obligation for packaging waste
-Non-compliance can be punished under certain conditions
-Excessive use could not be eliminated by a simple legal regulation
-Unconstitutionality remained and remains unaffected


-The Waste Framework Directive tightens the obligation of EU member states to ensure the separate collection of waste generated in households.
-By combining parallel collection systems with subsequent drying, the amount of recyclable materials is increased by mechanical sorting.
-The VerpackVO from 1991 did not live up to its intention of separate collection.
-Despite 30 years of continuous optimization efforts, it fell far short of its resource policy objective with regard to the disposal of LVP waste.
-In the concrete constellation, the maintenance of separate collection causes the resource policy opposite of what the EU Waste Framework Directive strives for through separate collection.


-Germany has had a strong influence on the development of European waste management
-European waste law has been trimmed in its direction
-Individual member states have only partially followed the mandatory regulations
-Germany is obliged to promote joint collection with subsequent drying and efficient sorting at a European level
-This would be an important step towards accelerating the exit from diverse energy dependency and on the way to sustainable resource management and climate-neutral energy production
