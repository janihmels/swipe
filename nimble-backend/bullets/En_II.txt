-Federal Environment Minister Töpfer proposed a pilot responsibility for the packaging industry to limit resource consumption.
-This would be done through waste disposal based on the recycling economy.
-The market area is manageable and has a clearly defined function.
-The product concerned usually has a limited lifespan, making it an ideal part of the economy to test market-based instruments for ecological control of resource consumption.


-Retailers were obligated to take back packaging waste they placed on the market and return it to materials management.
-Retailers could free themselves from this obligation by paying license fees.
-License fees were paid to the monopoly with the green dot and after its dissolution, to the competing system operators of the Dual System Germany (DSD).
-Payments covered separate collection and recycling of materials used, as well as overhead for organizational processing.
-IVB was free to recoup expense with usual surcharges when selling packaged goods.


-The DSD continued and further developed the collection and recycling of glass and paper/cardboard/cardboard.
-Cooperation with local disposal companies was not without conflict.
-Töpfer did not place responsibility for product packaging on producers, allowing them to act more cost-oriented than on usability of product material.


-Protection of food from spoilage by extending shelf life and naming an end date
-General protection against damage during transport and storage
-Use for instructions for use and image-cultivating design
-Anti-theft device
-Resource-saving benefit of measures exceeds resources used
-Sales-promoting effect steers main interest of retailers in this direction


-The DSD's controlling influence through license fees has been inefficient and unsuccessful.
-Companies have tried to evade the license payment through various means.
-This has increased the cost burden for companies that met their obligations correctly.
-Arguments about this have been ongoing for years, resulting in a collection volume that has exceeded the licensed volume at times.


-DSD was threatened with financial collapse due to free-riding and limited use of yellow collection containers
-50% of misthrows were registered in metropolitan areas
-Materials that were recorded could only be recycled to a small extent
-DSD fell far short of the recycling quota of 64% of packaging placed on the market, as stipulated in the Packaging Ordinance
-Trade remained obliged to take back products despite proper licensing
-Politicians have not drawn necessary conclusions, despite emergency disposal situation being averted
