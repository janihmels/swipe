-5% of separately collected plastic waste is converted into new material
-The rest is largely recycled and used to generate energy
-Energy recovery is mainly carried out as a substitute fuel in the cement industry and in power plants
-30% of the population do not participate in the Yellow Bag system, resulting in lower recycling volume
-Many municipalities do not operate separate collection in the collection system, but via recycling depots


-CO2 release and costs can be reduced dramatically by integrating collection into household waste collection
-Effort for ZSVR and authorities at all three political levels, chambers of industry and commerce, etc. would be eliminated
-Collection process would become more efficient and cost-effective


-70% of the 80 million inhabitants in Germany participate in providing free services
-Every second person spends 12 minutes a week doing so
