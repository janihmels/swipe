-2. The need for a new organization:The ZSVR would have to be given a new legal form and the necessary powers to carry out its tasks. It should be given the authority to issue binding regulations and to impose sanctions in the event of non-compliance. In addition, it should be able to set up an independent monitoring system and, if necessary, initiate legal proceedings against those responsible for non-compliance. Furthermore, it should be able to take over the management of Stabilatanlagen in order to ensure that they are operated in accordance with the applicable regulations. Finally, it should be able to provide financial support for the conversion process.


-Conversion to Stabilat or similar cannot happen overnight
-Changeover must take place gradually and at the pace of individual municipal plants
-Conversion will take years, even with reduced approval times
-Full conversion only complete when last stabilizer facility in Germany is commissioned
-Remaining parts of packaging pallet should be brought back under full responsibility of municipalities at this point


-Remunicipalisation of waste disposal
-Transfer of tasks and payment claims from system operators to respective municipality
-Citizens receive money back to finance DSD with purchase of packaged goods
-Financing via shop price retained until last municipality completes changeover


-Huge challenge to convert to separate collection
-Investments required should not be underestimated, both financially and otherwise
-Municipalities could get together for joint projects
-System operators could get involved in co-collection
-Municipalities could manage co-collection with less effort than system operators
-Opportunity to get rid of refuse-derived fuel for lower co-payment than before
-Fee will become significantly more expensive in the foreseeable future due to CO2 fee and alternative fuel used in cement industry etc.
-Federal government should consider registering project for EU's recovery and resilience facility
