Packaging waste as a disposal problem: At the end of the 1980s, growing resistance to landfill sites and waste incineration plants (MVA) led to fears of a nationwide waste emergency. That drew attention to the packaging. They contributed – and the trend is increasing – with around 50 percent by volume and 30 percent by weight to the total volume of household waste. The municipal level responsible for disposal reacted with quite successful systems for the separate collection of waste glass and paper and mostly found sufficient buyers on the market at reasonable conditions. However, this did not apply to plastic packaging. The municipal level could certainly have recorded them separately, but found no acceptable marketing opportunities. The federal government has taken on the problem by privatizing the disposal of all packaging waste, which had previously been organized by the municipality.
