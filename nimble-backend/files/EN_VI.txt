As under IV.2. As explained above, about 5% of the separately collected plastic waste is currently converted into new material and the rest is largely recycled and used to generate energy. Due to the high calorific value of plastic, energy recovery is mainly carried out as a substitute fuel in the cement industry and in power plants. In this respect, the results of the two different approaches are basically identical. Only the 30% of the population who do not participate in the Yellow Bag system result in a lower recycling volume compared to the stabilized dry product. It is further increased by the fact that in southern Germany a large number of municipalities do not yet operate the separate collection in the collection system, but via recycling depots. The last-mentioned deficits would be cleared up by the conversion pursued here at no cost.

The decisive factor, however, is that the CO2 release as well as the costs could be reduced dramatically by integrating the collection into the collection of household waste. A large part of the effort for the ZSVR and for authorities at all three political levels, the chambers of industry and commerce, etc. would also be eliminated.

And last but not least: If you assume that 56 million (70%) of the 80 million inhabitants participate and that every second person spends 12 minutes a week doing so, this results in an annual amount of a good 3.3 billion based on the current minimum wage € (see Baum, Müll und Abfall 2018, p. 367 ). This is a rough estimate, but it should be of the order of magnitude. In other words, the state asks its citizens to create the prerequisites for an artificial market by providing free services, which in turn is financed by making a contribution to the purchase of packaged goods.
