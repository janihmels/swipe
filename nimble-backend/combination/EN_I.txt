SUMMARY: 
Packaging waste is a major contributor to household waste, making up 50% of the total volume and 30% of the total weight. Separate collection of glass and paper waste has been successful, but plastic packaging has not been collected separately due to a lack of acceptable marketing opportunities. In response, the federal government has taken on the problem by privatizing the disposal of all packaging waste.
