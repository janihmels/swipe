SUMMARY: 
The dry stabilizer process is a waste management system that significantly reduces the volume of waste and dries it without the need for external energy. This process was given a chance by the Environment Minister, resulting in successful reduction in waste volume and energy consumption. It has generated attractive earnings opportunities for waste management, posed a serious threat to the DSD and its multi-billion dollar market, and faced stiff competition from traditional waste incineration. Despite powerful headwinds, Hofmann achieved a surprisingly quick market entry in Germany and other European countries. However, due to a large energy supplier acquiring a majority in the new partner through share purchases, the groundbreaking innovation came to an abrupt end. Decarbonizing cities can be achieved by including this procedure, supplementing waste-to-energy plants with hydrogen production plants, converting vehicle fleets to hydrogen fuel, and operating MHKW with dry stabilizer.

BULLETPOINTS: 
-2. Benefits: This process has the advantage of significantly reducing the volume of waste, as well as drying it without the need for external energy.

3. Result: The Environment Minister's decision to give the dry stabilizer process a chance resulted in a successful reduction in waste volume and energy consumption.


-Average of 270 kg of water extracted from a ton of household waste and household-type commercial waste
-Mechanical separation of around 210 kg of non-combustible fractions (ferrous and non-ferrous metals, heavy metals, inert material)
-Further mechanical differentiation with the aim of material recycling (glass, sorted by colour)
-Plastics can be sorted and calorific value lowered if necessary
-520 kg of storable refuse-derived fuel with a calorific value between 15 and 18 MJ/kg
-CO2 emission factor is 24 g/kg, less than a quarter of that of lignite


-Hofmann installed an EVA energy recovery plant at the site of the pilot plant, supplying the entire waste disposal plant with electricity and heat.
-He was able to sell the remaining three quarters in cement works and as a substitute for coal without any problems.
-The five other German plants also had no significant sales problems.
-42,500 t of refuse-derived fuel produced annually in Dresden were processed into methanol in the secondary raw materials center at Schwarze Pumpe SVZ.
-SVZ saw great opportunities in hydrogen production.


-Dry stabilizer process created attractive earnings opportunities for waste management
-Process posed a serious threat to the DSD and its multi-billion dollar market
-Traditional waste incineration also faced stiff competition
-Hofmann had to deal with powerful headwinds


-Hofmann was given no state-opened legal opportunity to play to his strengths
-He achieved a surprisingly quick market entry in Germany and other European countries
-A large energy supplier acquired a majority in the new partner through share purchases, and the latter withdrew from the cooperation with Hofmann
-The groundbreaking innovation came to an abrupt end
-The medium-sized company found it difficult to sell its patents to avoid insolvency
-The new patent holders were forced to relocate their activities abroad, mainly in Asia and China


-A.R.T. Trier under the direction of Prof. Pretz from the RWTH Aachen University conducted a study in 2010
-The light fraction collected in parallel in the catchment area was added to the domestic waste and mixed material was subjected to stabilization
-Subsequent sorting separated 97% of the plastics
-Results of this study demonstrate that politics can oppose progress


-Federal Environment Minister showed no inclination to give progress a chance
-Main argument was reference to qualitative impairment of recyclables due to initial mixing with household waste
-Separate collection also has misjudgments and requires a solution


-generated in the United States each year, the energy industry is a large and growing sector.
-The energy industry is a large and growing sector, with almost 15 million tons of household waste and household-type waste generated in the United States each year.
-The energy industry includes activities such as electricity generation, oil and gas production, renewable energy production, and nuclear power.
-The US Energy Information Administration estimates that total US energy consumption will increase by about 10% between 2018 and 2040.
-The US Department of Energy estimates that renewable energy sources will account for nearly 30% of total US electricity generation by 2030.
-The International Energy Agency projects that global energy demand will increase by more than 25% between 2018 and 2040.


-More than 7 million tons of dry stabilizer can be obtained.
-Use of lignite for energy production can be reduced.
-Dependence on Russian gas and Russian oil can be reduced in this magnitude.
-2.7 million tonnes of LVP (minus ferrous and non-ferrous metals) with a calorific value of 40 MJ/kg can be added to dramatically increase quantity and calorific value.


-Merging of the recording systems of two households
-Collection systems brought together and dried together with subsequent mechanical sorting
-Quotas specified by the Packaging Act easily met
-Operator of a Stabilat plant has access to entire LVP quantity


-Abolition of LVP separate collection would trigger significant savings in diesel fuel with corresponding decarbonization
-Routes of dual systems are largely identical to those of municipal household waste collection
-Breakpoints are also the same
-Provision of containers, their administration and organization of disposal would be eliminated
-Mechanical separation of waste and their transport to municipal waste disposal company would also be eliminated


-Decarbonizing cities by including proposed procedure
-Supplementing waste-to-energy plants (MHKW) with a plant for the production of hydrogen
-Converting vehicle fleet to hydrogen fuel
-Supplying collection vehicles with hydrogen on the spot at start of new tour
-Operating MHKW with dry stabilizer and eliminating parallel LVP recording to optimize climate protection in long term
