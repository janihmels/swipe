SUMMARY: 
Waste can be used as an energy source to generate electricity and heat, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create jobs in the waste management sector. Dry stabilization produces storable fuel that can be used to compensate for fluctuations in wind and solar power. A large-scale study found that material recycling of packaging waste is ecologically superior to energetic use, but all available options should be exhausted in 2023 and beyond. Necessity to reduce and ultimately prevent use of lignite for energy production has been set with a goal of phasing out lignite by 2038. Merging of collection streams creates flexibility and technical precaution prevents loss of advantage. Sorting cascade after drying can be aligned in terms of energy and material, enabling technical constellations for short-term needs-based conversions.

BULLETPOINTS: 
-2. Exploiting waste as an energy source: Waste can be used as an energy source, either through direct combustion or through conversion into biogas. This is a valuable resource that can be used to generate electricity and heat, and can also be used to produce synthetic fuels.

3. Benefits of using waste as an energy source: Using waste as an energy source has many benefits, including reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and providing a renewable energy source. Additionally, it can help reduce dependence on fossil fuels and create jobs in the waste management sector.


-Modern ways of thinking prioritize environmental and resource protection.
-Waste should be used in meaningful ways with minimal effort.
-Thermal destruction of inadequately dried waste is not justified.
-Municipalities often act as petitioners to get rid of their waste quickly and with high co-payments.


-Dry stabilization produces storable fuel that can be used to compensate for fluctuations in wind and solar power
-Alternative fuel can compete ecologically with lignite and help to oust it from electricity and heat generation in the long term
-Technical potential to generate usable materials from waste and orientate ejection to market requirements
-Political specifications required for possible uses in practice, which can also be combined with incentives under waste law


-A large-scale study commissioned by the DSD found that material recycling of packaging waste is ecologically superior to energetic use.
-The study did not include the entire effort including separate recording.
-There is a need to use all generated waste as energetically as possible in order to reduce energy dependency.
-All available options, including less climate-friendly methods, should be exhausted in 2023 and beyond.


-Necessity to reduce and ultimately prevent use of lignite for energy production
-Displacement per unit could be increased with combustible LVP materials
-Germany set official date for phasing out lignite as 2038, but talk of 2030 and calls for further reductions in service life are becoming louder
-Possibility to expand energy orientation to 100 percent climate-neutral energy production


-Merging of collection streams creates flexibility
-Technical precaution prevents loss of advantage
-Sorting cascade after drying can be aligned in terms of energy and material
-Enables technical constellations for short-term needs-based conversions
-No reason to delay adoption of traditional separate collection of LVP group
-Plastics and other materials can be filtered out of dried household and household-type commercial waste using current state of sorting technology
