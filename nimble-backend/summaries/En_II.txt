Federal Environment Minister TÃ¶pfer proposed a pilot responsibility for the packaging industry to limit resource consumption through waste disposal based on the recycling economy. Retailers were obligated to take back packaging waste they placed on the market and return it to materials management, or free themselves from this obligation by paying license fees. The DSD continued and further developed the collection and recycling of glass and paper/cardboard/cardboard, but faced financial collapse due to free-riding and limited use of yellow collection containers. Despite this, politicians have not drawn necessary conclusions, despite emergency disposal situation being averted.
