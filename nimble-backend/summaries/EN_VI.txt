This article discusses the current state of plastic waste management in Germany. 5% of separately collected plastic waste is converted into new material, while the rest is largely recycled and used to generate energy. Energy recovery is mainly carried out as a substitute fuel in the cement industry and in power plants. However, 30% of the population do not participate in the Yellow Bag system, resulting in lower recycling volume. Additionally, many municipalities do not operate separate collection in the collection system, but via recycling depots. To improve this situation, CO2 release and costs can be reduced by integrating collection into household waste collection. This would also eliminate effort for ZSVR and authorities at all three political levels, chambers of industry and commerce, etc., making the collection process more efficient and cost-effective. 70% of the 80 million inhabitants in Germany participate in providing free services for this purpose, spending an average of 12 minutes a week doing so. This results in an annual amount of 3.3 billion based on the current minimum wage, creating an artificial market which is financed by making a contribution to the purchase of packaged goods.
