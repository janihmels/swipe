The need for a new organization, the ZSVR, has been identified in order to facilitate the gradual conversion of Stabilatanlagen in Germany to separate collection. This organization would be given the authority to issue binding regulations and impose sanctions in the event of non-compliance. It would also be responsible for setting up an independent monitoring system and initiating legal proceedings against those responsible for non-compliance. The remunicipalisation of waste disposal, transfer of tasks and payment claims from system operators to respective municipalities, and citizens receiving money back to finance DSD with purchase of packaged goods are all part of this process. The challenge is huge and investments required should not be underestimated. Municipalities could get together for joint projects, system operators could get involved in co-collection, and municipalities could manage co-collection with less effort than system operators. The federal government should consider registering project for EU's recovery and resilience facility in order to finance this conversion process.
