The dry stabilizer process is a waste management system that significantly reduces the volume of waste and dries it without the need for external energy. This process was given a chance by the Environment Minister, resulting in successful reduction in waste volume and energy consumption. It has generated attractive earnings opportunities for waste management, posed a serious threat to the DSD and its multi-billion dollar market, and faced stiff competition from traditional waste incineration. Despite powerful headwinds, Hofmann achieved a surprisingly quick market entry in Germany and other European countries. However, due to a large energy supplier acquiring a majority in the new partner through share purchases, the groundbreaking innovation came to an abrupt end. Decarbonizing cities can be achieved by including this procedure, supplementing waste-to-energy plants with hydrogen production plants, converting vehicle fleets to hydrogen fuel, and operating MHKW with dry stabilizer.
