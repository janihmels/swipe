The Packaging Ordinance of 1991 in Germany required the separate recording of materials targeted for diversion from landfills and incineration plants. This was meant to anchor responsibility in a sub-area of economic life, without increasing costs or stricter requirements for the population. However, over time, this changed after the danger of the impending disposal emergency had been overcome and the requirement for separate collection was no longer applicable. The 1998 amendment to the Packaging Ordinance marked a turning point in time, as it made separation of recyclable waste a legal obligation for packaging waste with non-compliance punishable under certain conditions. The Waste Framework Directive further tightened this obligation by requiring EU member states to ensure the separate collection of waste generated in households. Despite 30 years of continuous optimization efforts, it fell far short of its resource policy objective with regard to the disposal of LVP waste. Germany is now obliged to promote joint collection with subsequent drying and efficient sorting at a European level as an important step towards accelerating the exit from diverse energy dependency and on the way to sustainable resource management and climate-neutral energy production.
