Waste can be used as an energy source to generate electricity and heat, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create jobs in the waste management sector. Dry stabilization produces storable fuel that can be used to compensate for fluctuations in wind and solar power. A large-scale study found that material recycling of packaging waste is ecologically superior to energetic use, but all available options should be exhausted in 2023 and beyond. Necessity to reduce and ultimately prevent use of lignite for energy production has been set with a goal of phasing out lignite by 2038. Merging of collection streams creates flexibility and technical precaution prevents loss of advantage. Sorting cascade after drying can be aligned in terms of energy and material, enabling technical constellations for short-term needs-based conversions.
